# Ignition 2015 Week 3: Intro to Rails
## Required
### Ponder and answer these questions as you work through the other material for this week.
- What is a framework?
- What's the difference between a programming language and a framework?
- What’s the difference between a library and a framework?
- What languages have frameworks?

### Resources
- Read “what is a framework” description on the Odin project.
- Read the What is Ruby on Rails 
- Do the CodeLearn course, Module 1

### Weekly Project - As a Group
- As a group, create a new Cloud9 project to walk through the Jumpstart Labs Blogger tutorial sections I0-I4 and push a completed solution up to the repo. 
  - In this project, you need use a Cloud9 “Custom” workspace (“Custom” and not “Rails” because you will be setting up your own Rails app inside the Custom workspace). 
  - Set up the the workspace such that you create the `blogger` rails folder within your project, but that you only commit the `blogger` folder to GitHub.  This means you will need to run `git init` within `blogger` and do all your commits from there.
  - Starting the app up is going to be different than what Jumpstart Labs tells you.  You are going to run `rails s -p $PORT -b $IP` in the Cloud9 terminal and then visit the link it tells you in the pop up.
  - Each individual needs to put a link to this repo in their deliverables/README.md.
- Once you get your app working on your Cloud9 workspace (or at the very end), deploy it to Heroku (here’s how, and here’s some additional help). 
  - Stuck? Here’s some common problems people run into during the Jumpstart tutorial
  - Include a link to your app on heroku in your deliverables/README.md
- If you’d like to take it to the next level, do section I5 with authentication, and even I6 if you are feeling extra crazy. 

## Optional
- Complete the Rails for Zombies challenges
- Watch Hartl’s 10 min youtube video about Rails. 
- Read this Medium How I learned Ruby on Rails article
